# Context_22_GuardiumRestAPI

Contains a fully working Python3 script for executing a RestAPI against a Guardium appliance to execute a report.

In particular in contains and execute all the Authentication part in python, something I have not found readily available.

It is also parameterized : 1 json file for connection information (sample added) and 1 json file for report parameters (sample added)

Don't forget to create first the secret and the client id from cli on the target appliance. 
grdapi register_oauth_client client_id=client_id1     - client_id is the SAME as application_id .....
see : https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1404guardrestapi/index.html

Also the output generated by the restAPI is an array of JSON dictionaries, displayed 1 per line

Example :
- install python3 and optionally virtual env
- install libraires
- install python script Report_D.py - Optionally change its name)
- copy and edit parama_data.json, in the same directory. This file contains the connection information specific to your environment
- generate (optionally from sample TrafficVerif.json) the file containing the name of your report and its parameters
- run as follows:
     python3 Report_D.py TrafficVerif
     
I tested this from a Linux server

Have fun.
