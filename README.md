# Context_22_GuardiumRestAPI

Contains a basic but working Python3 script for executing a RestAPI against a Guardium appliance to execute a report.

In particular in contains and execute all the Authentication part in python, something I have not found readily available.

I will make it more paramtered later but for now, you have to change the code in a very few places to make it work for you

Don't forget to create first the secret and the client id from cli on the target appliance.

Also the output is as generated by the restAPI meaning it's just a gigantic JSON dictionary

Have fun.
